## Documentation on how to get started with the `@oasis/web` package

**The `@oasis/web` package is Oasis's Next.JS Frontend**.<br>
`@oasis/web` is our React-based frontend, built using [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com/), [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

### Package Scripts

- `build` - This script runs the Next.JS compiler, which makes a production build for the whole frontend.
- `start` - This script runs a Next.JS **production** server _(you probably won't need this in most cases)._
- `dev` - This script runs a Next.JS **development** server, which lets you edit the frontend with features like hot-reload, Just-In-Time compiling for Tailwind styles and more.
