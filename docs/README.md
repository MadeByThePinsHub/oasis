- [With Gitpod](dev-env/gitpod.md) - Gitpod is free for public repos for up to 50 hours (unlimited on [an special plan](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/professional-open-source) for professional open-source contributors and maintainers).
- [With Code Server](dev-env/code-server.md) - Prefer not to use Gitpod? Deploy an `code-server` instance in your favorite PaaS service that support Dockerfiles. (You can even deploy this boilerplate into your bare metal or shiny Linode VM with the bootstrapper scripts.)
